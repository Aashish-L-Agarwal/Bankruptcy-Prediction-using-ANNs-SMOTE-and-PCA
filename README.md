# Bankruptcy-Prediction-using-ANNs-SMOTE-and-PCA

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) combined with PCA, SMOTE and BSM to address the challenging task of corporate bankruptcy prediction by employing it on a large dataset consisting of 95 financial ratios using a proprietary bayesian optimisation hypertuning algorithm. The research provides novel insights into the use of ANNs for corporate bankruptcy prediction, and the effect of incorporating oversampling strategies and preprocessing techniques such as PCA, dropout, and batch normalization, which can significantly improve model performance. These findings have important implications for financial institutions and investors, who can leverage these techniques to better predict and mitigate bankruptcy risk.
